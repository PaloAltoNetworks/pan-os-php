[ghost/TMP objects are IP-address directly defined in Rules]

    - has
		- based on object names (not values)
		- the filter will first check whether the object even exists (ignores ghost/TMP objects)
		- the filter will return partial AND full matches
		- this filter does not match "any"
		- example: 
			- filter is 8.8.8.8 and the rule destination is 8.8.8.8 and 4.4.4.4, it will match
			- filter is 8.8.8.8 and the rule destination is 8.8.8.8, it will match
