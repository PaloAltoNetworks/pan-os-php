Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PAN-OS SDK for PHP could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official pan-os-php docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

The main documentation is in the `docs` directory and the API reference is
generated from APIgen in the code.

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-php/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
